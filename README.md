# Covid19-website
It is a project from the course called Agile web project at my university. My teacher asked me to create a website which can provide the real statistic from the database to the users based on the user's input. This main website's function is providing the total cases, the death cases, and recovered cases of COVID19 according to date and country.
The website includes 3 pages such as the main page, statistic and take action page.
The main page provides the general information about the project and a nagviate bar to help directing to other functions
The stastic page is a location that get input from users, and then provide the real stastics of COVID19 to users
The take action page provides the useful advices and information to help people prevent the COVID19. Each steps are linked with the realiable website to give more relevant useful information.
